# ERP Core (NodeJS)

## Description
This project storescore logic cusch as constants and entities used in my simulated manufacturing projects. These entities are centralized as they are common across several microservices.

Common logic for the suite of modules that make up the entire inventory tracking system, an example of a production level real world application.
