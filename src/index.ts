/**
 * Barrel file for exports. A few points worth noting. 
 * 
 * - The 'export *' syntax is required for exporting functions
 * - On the other hand, the 'import/export' pattern exposed here, verbose as it is, 
 * is aboslutely required when classes are in play. This is required as there are 
 * known issues when using tsc in esm mode. Possible enhancement is switching to tsup.
